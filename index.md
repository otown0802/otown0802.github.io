I'm a 23 year old natural history camera operator working on projects for National Geographic, PBS Nature, BBC, etc. I specialize in macro, timelapse, and motion control - but have experience with high speed, camera trapping, and long lens work. I have also built custom studio equiptment for unique shots otherwise impossible - This includes:  multi-axis dragonframe motion control units for extremely dynamic moves, a controlled deep freezer timelapse studio for shots of frost formation, and a high speed spinning rig for rotating shots of rain falling at 1000 fps. feel free to reach me at [otown0802@gmail.com](mailto:otown0802@gmail.com)
